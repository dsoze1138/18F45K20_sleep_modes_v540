# 18F45K20 sleep mode demo
==========================

MPLABX v5.40 sample project to show using sleep mode with 
DM164130-4 - PICkit 44-Pin Demo Board for the 18F45K20.

It is unfortunate that Microchip no longer offers these 
kinds of demo boards as they are ideal to run code that 
requires the controller be connected to a minimum of 
external hardware to verify the code has configured the 
controller for minimum current.
